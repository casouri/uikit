#+TITLE: UIKit

*Abandoned and why:* The goal of this project is basically a GUI that you see on a terminal, but implemented in Emacs buffer and comes with auto layouts in "modern GUI"s. I found this method is quite foreign for Emacs and went for another approach.

-----

This package aims to provide a high level framework
and a set of useful widgets to help developers 
make GUI in Emacs.

Features:

- Text based :: Everything is text.

- Auto layout :: You never need to worry about positions,
     UIKit does all the layout arranging and content drawing.
     All you do is configure the layout and update widget
     content.
