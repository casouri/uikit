#+TITLE: UIKit

* Important

*This package is in early development stage, I upload the code so I can ask specific questions in the forum.*

This package aims to provide a high level framework
and a set of useful widgets to help developers 
make GUI in Emacs.

Features:

- Text based :: Everything is text.

- Auto layout :: You never need to worry about positions,
     UIKit does all the layout arranging and content drawing.
     All you do is configure the layout and update widget
     content.
